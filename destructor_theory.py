destructor --

AS we know that Python contain Automatic Garbage collect , whose work is to delete / vacate
all the used memory after the complete execution of my program / script.

But if we want delete or vacate the used memory before the complete execution of my program/script
or we can if we want to delete the object space occupied by object of a class for deleting
the used space of object before the final exceution of program/ script we will  be using
destructor __del__ , This __del__ is a magic function or predefine function which delete the
object before the final execution of program/script.
